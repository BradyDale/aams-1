# AMS-1: American Adult Male Standard

**Status:** Draft  
An open standard for low-friction, socially coherent adult male dress.

## Purpose

AMS-1 defines a baseline system of male public presentation that:

- Minimizes daily decision fatigue  
- Signals social participation  
- Scales across social and professional contexts  

This document is written in the format of a technical standard. It is partly serious, partly cultural commentary, and fully open to revision.

## Scope

This is a **baseline** system. Personal style is optional and layered on top.

The goal is not fashion performance, but clear, consistent signaling of adulthood, social awareness, and shared norms.

## Structure

- **Operational Contexts** define when and why clothing changes
- **Jackets and Shoes** form the structural core of male presentation
- **The Closet** defines interoperable wardrobe components
- **Protocol** maps clothing to context
- **Grooming** and **Overdressing** define behavioral standards

## Visual Reference

A companion visual guide with example outfits and garment references can be found here:

**[Visual Examples →](visual-examples.md)**

These examples illustrate how the protocol looks in practice across different **Operational Contexts** and garment categories.

## How to Use

Read the protocol. Adopt what’s useful. Submit pull requests for improvements, regional variations, or clarifications.

## Background and Prior Work

This standard builds on and extends several earlier conversations about male dress, social signaling, and the loss of shared clothing norms.

Notable prior influences include:

- Paul Skallas, *“[Why Do We Dress So Badly?](https://lindynewsletter.beehiiv.com/p/why-do-we-dress-so-badly)”* (The Lindy Newsletter)  
  A cultural analysis arguing that the collapse of the male uniform left most men without a stable dressing system.

- r/malefashionadvice, *“[The Basic Bastard” Wardrobe Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1dc/the_basic_bastard_basic_wardrobe_and_inspiration/)*  
  A widely shared attempt to provide a simplified starter wardrobe for men new to dressing intentionally.

AAMS-1 differs in that it:

- Treats clothing as a **social signaling protocol**, not a shopping list  
- Defines **operational contexts** as the decision framework  
- Centers jackets and shoes as the primary structural elements  
- Aims for **interoperability and stability** rather than trend fluency

This project should be understood as a continuation and formalization of those earlier efforts, not a rejection of them.
