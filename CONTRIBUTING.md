# Contributing to AMS-1

Thanks for helping refine the Adult Male Standard.

This project is written in the format of a technical specification. Contributions should preserve that tone and structure.

## What We Welcome

Pull requests that:

- Clarify operational contexts
- Improve garment interoperability
- Add regional appendices (desert climates, Nordic winters, Texas formal, etc.)
- Suggest culturally stable alternatives that fit the system logic
- Improve clarity without increasing complexity

## What This Is Not

This is not a trend tracker or fashion hype document. Submissions based on:

- Fast fashion cycles  
- Celebrity imitation  
- Micro-trend aesthetics  
- Brand evangelism  

will likely be declined.

## Style Guidelines

- Maintain spec-style tone
- Keep language clear and structured
- Preserve operational context logic (**Athletic**, **Chill**, **Casual**, **Elevate**, etc.)
- Avoid turning the document into a shopping list or brand directory

## Pull Request Advice

If proposing a change:

1. Identify the operational context(s) affected  
2. Explain the social signal being improved  
3. Keep additions minimal and interoperable  

Small, well-justified changes are more likely to be accepted than sweeping rewrites.

## Forks and High-Context Variants

Forks of AMS-1 that adapt the protocol to specific cultural, regional, occupational, or subcultural contexts are welcome.

High-context variants are encouraged when they preserve the underlying aim of the Standard: elevating men and enabling men to signal to one another that they are willing participants in shared norms, mutual respect, and the ongoing work of a healthy society.

Adaptations may change garments, materials, or conventions, but should maintain:

- Clear operational contexts  
- Low decision burden  
- Interoperable wardrobe logic  
- The signaling of adulthood, responsibility, and social participation  

Forks that turn the protocol into a trend engine, status competition, or purely aesthetic performance diverge from the intent of the Standard.
